# PID_Controller_STM32_CubeIDE

it is the whole directory of a [STM32](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html) project that meant to build a PID-Controller<br>
The codes of the PID controller are written in [CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) with [HAL library](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um1786-description-of-stm32f3-hal-and-lowlayer-drivers-stmicroelectronics.pdf) and listed as usual in the core file separated in .h and .c files<br>
